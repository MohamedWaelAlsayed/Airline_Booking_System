# Airline-Booking-System
Database project made as a part of the course Advanced database.
The main purpose of this project is to provide a convenient way to search and book flights
for customers. The system provides customers with the facility to book a ticket and cancel a
particular reservation. The system provides options for viewing and booking different
flights available with different timings for a particular date with the option to look for flights
via direct one-stop flight.
